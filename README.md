# HELP-ANDREW-PUBLISH-HIS-HISTORICAL-WHAT-IF-BOOK
My name is Andrew Meidal. I'm a history buff who loves to read about "what if" scenarios in history, especially during the world wars. I have always been fascinated by how different decisions could have changed the course of history, and this passion has driven me to write a book exploring these intriguing possibilities.
